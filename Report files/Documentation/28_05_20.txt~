1. Implemented DCN EDVR model for AlexNet,ResNet18. Can run from home easily

2. Remove plot, save figure to EPS file instead:
	fixes the Pycharm not-printing-test-results-bug. Also EPS is better

3. Add argument parser - transform into proper script. Arguments:
	log file name      	- path to log file
	image file name    	- path to output image
	data set directory 	- path to data set directory
	architecture       	- what architecture to use (AlexNet,Resnet18,Resnet50) 
	DCN			- use DCN or not (boolean)
	epochs			- number of epochs
