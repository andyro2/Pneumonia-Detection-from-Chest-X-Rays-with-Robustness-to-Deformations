1) run known architecture on some images 	- [V]
2) run known architecture on X-rays 		- [V]
3) run known architecture + DCN on X-rays	
4) run different architectures +DCN on x-rays

Tasks:

1) Re-arrange data - random grouping (by 60%-20%-20%)
2) Plots: legend, xlabel, ylabel, grid
3) More epochs 		- smoother plots
4) Code maintenence 	- modularity, commenting, etc.
5) Visualizations 	- real-time plots - optional (maybe flag)
6) Export network 	- might be a trouble. Consult with Yair
6) Buy GPU (lol 2broke4me)
